After spending summer 2020 in Barcelona (Spain) with my girlfriend, we decided to move to Greece for the end of the year. We were expecting to go to Bali at first, but we couldn’t go there due to coronavirus. So we stayed in Europe, in the only country with a great temperature during fall.

We started with 2 weeks of travelling, going from Athen, to Mykonos, Paros, Naxos, Santorini, and finally Crete, our final destination.

We didn’t work in the island, it was just holidays, and I don’t think it would have been easy to work: wifi is not that great in the island, and all those places are designed for tourists.

## Our holidays in Athens & the Greek Islands

### Athen

We landed in Athen end of September 2020, and we stayed a few days there. We visited as much as we could, and enjoyed our first bites of Greek food.

We were amazed how cheap the prices are in Athen, and how good is the food. It seemed very authentic and very local to us, even more when we compared to the Island that are very touristy.

### Mykonos

Then we took the ferry to Mykonos.

Mykonos is a very beautiful Island, it looks like the typical greek island cliché. The only downfall is that prices are really expensive, it’s probably the most expensive greek island with Santorini, and it looks a little bit too touristy.

With Covid 19, we didn’t see the nightlife as more clubs were empty, but at least we had the beaches for ourselves!

We took the ferry to Naxos, a calmer island known to be great for couples: and it was!

We loved the restaurants, the city center.

## Paros

Paros is the island for couples. We had an amazing time here: it's so calm, cosy, and with nice restaurants.

We went to Moraitis Winery to taste some good wine.

## Naxos

Then we went to Naxos.

Naxos is great for hiking, with the Zeus Mount, the highest mountain in the greek island. It’s a nice trip to go to the top!

## Santorini

We had high expectations when we arrived in Santorini, and we had a really great stay.

The view was amazing, and with Covid, it was just for us :)

We spent a day on a boat, had a barbecue, went swimming with the fishes.

At the end of this trip, we went to Chania, Crete, to stay 1.5 months there.

## Life in Chania, Crete

### Rent

We found a small house on AirBnb in the center of Chania. We paid XX € / night / person.

The house was ok: well located, with enough space to live, but it was definitely old & wifi was not amazing (10Mb/s).

Thankfully, there was a brand new coworking space just the street next to it. It was great for days when we needed a great wifi.

### Coworking space

The coworking space is Workhub Chania, and it was great.

**Pros:**

- The wifi was fast (optic fibre)
- There was phone booth for calls
- You could plug your laptop in Ethernet for even faster speeds
- Nice & helpful owner

**Cons:**

- The price was a little bit high compared to the cost of life in Greece (67€/week & 265€/month), so I only went there when I needed good internet.

### Food

Chania is a touristic city with lots of restaurant in front of the sea. We tried many of them during our stay, and loved the quality of the food.

Prices were average for Europe: not expensive but not cheap either.

### Fun & visits

Crete is full of nice places to visit, and you have beaches & mountain, at the same place.

We went to Elafonissi (in mid-October), and we enjoyed it like it was the middle of summer.

We went hiking in the Samarias Gorge, a 14km hike in the Mountain.

## Life in Athen, Greece

After spending 1.5 month in Crete, we decided to move to Athen before going back to France for Christmas.

### Rent

We found a nice 2 bedroom suite in a hotel that we shared with another digital nomad couple, the price was just amazing: 200€/month/person = 6,66€ per night in a 4 star all furnished hotel !!

### Coworking space

The hotel Wi-Fi was ok, but not good enough to be 4 working on it all day.

We found a brand having several coworking spaces in the center of Athen, and we had quite a mixed experience with it.

**Pro:**

- Value for money was good. The price was 110€/month.
- One of their location was in the center in a beautiful building. It was a really great place to work.
- In one of the location, the staff was nice.

**Cons:**

- In the closest location to our place, the staff was not friendly and not helpful at all.
- In the closest location to our place, their was one phone booth for the whole coworking space. Of course it was always busy!
- They didn’t tell us that the coworking space business model was a subscription, and that we had to cancel the subscription 30 days before leaving. As we were staying like 40 days there, it means that we should have cancelled our subscription right when we arrived. They never told us of course, and they tried to charge us an extra month (despite us being back in France), and were really rude by email.

I just think it’s the kind of shady company that don’t care and don’t respect their users. Their only goal is to make short-term money, without caring about our experience and our need. Why would I pay one more month if I’m not even in the country anymore?

### Food

We loved the food when we went to Athen in September, but this time everything was closed due to Covid lockdown. We still ordered food online with Wolt (Uber Eats in Greece), and enjoyed cheap Athen prices!

## Final words

We loved our stay in Greece. It’s one of the only country in Europe that’s still hot in fall/beginning of winter, so if you want to escape winter while staying in Europe, it’s definitely a great place to be!

Food is good, Wine is good, rent is affordable, and there are so many great things to do.

With coronavirus, we enjoyed empty touristic places. It was great, but sometimes a little sad to see those places empty. I’m sure Greece is even better when bars are full and people are out !
