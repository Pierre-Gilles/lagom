Hi, everyone! 


After more than 3 years of blogging about home automation on [Gladys Assistant](https://gladysassistant.com), I've decided to start a more personal blog in parallel.

The goal of this blog is to talk about things I can't talk on Gladys blog because it's too technical/too personal.

On this blog, I'm going to talk about two kinds of things, first is mostly about what I do on Gladys: 

### Engineering

- Back-end Development (Mostly around Node.js & PostgreSQL)
- Performance Optimization
- Code Quality/Unit Testing
- Continuous Integration/Deployment at scale

### Random Things

- How I work, How I organize myself
- Hardware reviews
- Marketing tools I use on Gladys Assistant
- Trip :)

I won't be only blogging about technical stuff as you can see, it's really a personal and opinionated blog about things I do in my life.
